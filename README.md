## Overview

This README provides insights into the development process of my web portfolio, including my approach, challenges faced, and lessons learned.

## Development Process

### Process Overview
My portfolio was developed using primarily Bootstrap 5 for the layout and styling, along with Animate.css for additional animation effects.

### Challenges Faced and Overcoming them
The most significant challenge I encountered during development was with implementing JavaScript functionalities. While this was initially daunting, after the discomfort had passed, I had to do little more than adding the already laid out JS Bootstrap, and tweaking it to my own styling. In hindsight, it was probably the "JavaScript" label that scared me since I know nothing about it. I spent a good amount of time scouring the Bootstrap website, though, and trying to make sure I knew my direction.

Another challenge of mine revolved around ensuring accessibility compliance, even with skiplinks (especially with skiplinks at times). Understanding and implementing accessibility features proved to be confusing initially. However, through research tools like WAVE, MDN, W3schools, and more, I gained a good foundational knowledge, and built upon it. I tested it until it became routine, but I must admit I still have a lot to learn when it comes to accessibility and it's implementation.


### UX Design vs. Website Development
A key learning from this project was the distinction between UX design and website development. While my Figma prototype served as a solid foundation, I realized I needed to prioritize the importance of refining design elements for a tighter and cleaner website layout. Consistency emerged as a crucial aspect, leading me to making adjustments such as standardizing button sizes for enhanced user experience. Additionally, I ommitted the leaves for the sake of a cleaner website so it didn't take away from my design, 

### Testing Limits and Capabilities
Developing my portfolio provided an opportunity to test my limits and capabilities. Despite encountering challenges, I managed to translate my design vision into reality, achieving outcomes that exceeded my expectations. The process was both tough and rewarding, allowing me to push boundaries and refine my skills.
